CSE167x is an introduction to Computer Graphics. Students will understand the concepts of 3D graphics, and develop programs that create images of a 3D scene with lighting, using both real-time OpenGL and GLSL programming, as well as offline raytracing. The focus is on foundations and writing your own programs, rather than learning use of a specific software like Maya or Photoshop. The current course has been upgraded to use modern OpenGL 3.1 with GLSL 330, the first major upgrade we have done in the past 5 years, and is designed to provide a completely modern introduction to computer graphics.

In this course, you will be learning the theory of computer graphics, as well as implementing practical systems for both real-time and offline graphics that utilize this knowledge. The course consists of four units, each with lecture videos and a programming assignment. By the end, you would have implemented a real-time scene viewer in OpenGL and GLSL, as well as a full raytracer to create realistic images of 3D scenes.
